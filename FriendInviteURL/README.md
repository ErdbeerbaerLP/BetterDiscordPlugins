# Friend Invite URL
**NOTE:** This plugin *does* access a discord feature that, to this date, has no UI made for it. It could be removed or changed at any time

This plugin adds a button to copy a friend invite url, which can be sent to other users to click on.
Users clicking on this link will add you as a friend, even if you disabled friend requests completely.

Those links are only valid for 7 days and this cannot be changed
